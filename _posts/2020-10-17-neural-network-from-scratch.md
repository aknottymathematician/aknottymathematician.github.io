# What is a Neural Network?
**Neural Networks** are basically an attempt to make a computer model of the brain. But even though the comparison with a biological neuron is pretty interesting, being a math student, I find it much easier to see an artificial neuron as mathematical functions that map given input with a desired output:

As you can see the input values $$x_1$$, $$x_2$$, $$x_3$$, multiplied by some weights $$w_1$$, $$w_2$$, $$w_3$$, are passed into some function $$\sigma$$ and output is some $$y$$. But I must admit here that I have grossly oversimplified this whole process and even though the basic idea remains the same there are multiple components and steps involved in the working of a neural network

So without further adieu let us dive into the basics of Neural Network Architecture.


# Architecture of a Neural Network
Let's start small, as we saw 




# Components of a Neural Network flow

I have divided the whole process of a neural network training into 5 parts:

Here's some basic text

And here's some in *italics*

Here's some **bold**

What about a [link](https://github.com/in/jasraj-date)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
-Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np
    
    def test_function(x,y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```
Here's some inline code `x+y`

Here's an image:

Here's another image using Kramdown:

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
