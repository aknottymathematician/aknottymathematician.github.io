# What is a Neural Network?
**Neural Networks** are basically an attempt to make a computer model of the brain. But although

Here's some basic text

And here's some in *italics*

Here's some **bold**

What about a [link](https://github.com/in/jasraj-date)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
-Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np
    
    def test_function(x,y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```
Here's some inline code `x+y`

Here's an image:

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/youtube-recommender-system.png)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
