I am an AI Engineer at [Miko](https://miko.ai/in), working in Natural Language Processing. I have completed my MSc in Mathematics from VNIT, Nagpur. I love mathI am a learner and the blog posts I share are essentially the notes I take while studying, so if you find any mistakes in theoretical sections or errors in the codes please drop in a mail, I'll make sure that I correct those as required.
